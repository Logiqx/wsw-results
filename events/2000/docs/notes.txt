Decided that sail number 5 was likely to be Graham Holbert since he competed on that number in 1999 + 2001.

Changed sail number of Danny Norris + Will Oscroft on the tandem to 6222.

Note that 300m record on 2 Oct is 37.02 in day results but 37.03 in the full list of runs.

Suspect day results round down to the nearest 100th (correctly) but all runs do not (incorrectly).

Potentially affects all years between 2000 and 2009.

Note: This was not an issue in 1998 and 1999 because 3 decimal places were used in the full list of runs.
