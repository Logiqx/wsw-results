Sail number changes:

- Changed sail number of Danny Norris + Will Oscroft on the tandem to 6222, distinct from Danny Norris 622.
- Changed sail number of Chris Evans and Philip Middleton to 99, leaving sail number 15 as Stephen Corps.
- Decided that sail number 5 was likely to be Graham Holbert since he competed on that number in 1999 + 2001.

Notes about rounding of 3 decimal places:

- Note that 300m record on 2 Oct is 37.02 in day results but 37.03 in the full list of runs.
- Suspect day results round down to the nearest 100th (correctly) but all runs do not (incorrectly).
- Potentially affects all years between 2000 and 2009.

Note: This was not an issue in 1998 and 1999 because 3 decimal places were used in the full list of runs.
