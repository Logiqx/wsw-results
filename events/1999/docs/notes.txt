4th October Results - comments taken directly from speedsailing.com

The results recorded on the timing boats on the speed course during the morning were lost.
A small number of runs during this time were recorded in the club house, however these are not a complete record.
The fastest wind surfer to be witnessed was Peter Martin sail number 181 at 28.42 knots, unfortunately this time has not been recorded although it appeared on the screens during the days sailing.
The fastest boat was Torix Bennett number 101 at 20.27 knots. There was no faster run witnessed during the day.
Therefore prizes have been presented to the above named.
It is inappropriate to award any prize for highest wind speed to sailing speed ratio.
