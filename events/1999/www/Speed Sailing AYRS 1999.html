    This evening seminar was held on the Wednesday of Weymouth Speedweek and as<br>
    usual it attracted a full house in the large upstairs meeting room at the<br>
    Royal Dorset Yacht Club. Michael Ellison took the chair and the meeting<br>
    progressed swiftly through a series of five minute talks with a halfway<br>
    break to watch video footage of the weeks events.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="SLADE PENOYRE">SLADE PENOYRE</a><br>
    Slade has a habit of putting into practice those simple ideas which many of<br>
    us may well have thought about but which rather fewer of us have actually<br>
    bothered to try for real. An example is his suggestion to use an air bag<br>
    hoisted to the masthead to right an inverted multihull, as now tried and<br>
    proven by Harvey Bowden - see below. Slade's idea for '99 is to use a<br>
    spinaker pole to hoist a bag of water to windward to improve the windward<br>
    performance of a monohull cruising yacht. This could be applicable to many<br>
    cruising yachts. It would not be so applicable to racing since it would<br>
    contravene most racing rules. The water bag would be used only for long<br>
    windward legs, just as a spinaker is normally used only for long off wind<br>
    legs. The time and effort required to set up the system would be at least<br>
    comparable to setting a spinaker so it would not be appropriate for short<br>
    legs.&nbsp; Slade showed a suitable bag manufactured by a company called Seaflex<br>
    and intended for use by divers to raise heavy objects from the seabed.<br>
    These sturdy bags are made from a plasticised fabric and fitted with strong<br>
    rope attachments. After rigging the spinaker pole the bag would be lowered<br>
    into the sea to fill it then raised again. Such a simple idea should not<br>
    cost much to try out. Slade is keen to get in touch with monohull owners who<br>
    would like to collaborate in trials.<br>
    <br>
    HARVEY BOWDEN<br>
    Harvey Bowden brought his highly tuned and stripped out Firebird catamaran<br>
    to this years Speedweek and used it not only for speed trials but also to<br>
    demonstrate Slade Penoyre's suggested self righting method. He has now<br>
    tested this self-righting method seventeen times with success on all but two<br>
    occasions. Unfortunately one of the two failures was during a demonstration<br>
    on the Tuesday of Speedweek and resulted in the breakage of an expensive<br>
    carbon fibre mast. During the interval we studied a video of the<br>
    demonstration. The main shrouds are both fitted to tackles and with the cat<br>
    capsized to a fully inverted position the shrouds were adjusted to incline<br>
    the mast under the water. An air filled bag, which I think was one<br>
    manufactured by Seaflex (as above), was then attached to a spare halyard and<br>
    winched to the masthead. This successfully brought the cat to an angle of<br>
    heel somewhat more than 90 degrees, floating on one hull with the mast tip<br>
    supported by the&nbsp; bag. The next stage is to incline the mast the opposite<br>
    way to cause the boat to overbalance and flip upright. Unfortunately at this<br>
    point the shroud out of the water was inadvertently slackened off whereas it<br>
    should have been kept tight. This meant that as the cat very suddenly<br>
    flipped upright the mast stayed roughly horizontal and smashed against the<br>
    hull. Harvey immediately ordered a new mast but obviously the boat was out<br>
    of action for the rest of Speedweek.<br>
    <br>
    Slade has since been thinking about avoiding the need for adjustable length<br>
    shrouds. In this case the final stages of righting would be by a pole and<br>
    water filled bag deployed from under the bridgedeck.<br>
    <br>
    During the interval we also watched video footage of Orion travelling at<br>
    well over 20 knots on the speed course. At these speeds the lee hull throws<br>
    up a most impressive bow wave.<br>
    <br>
    BOB QUINTON<br>
    Bob has designed and built an 8' long funboat called 'Broadboard'. This is a<br>
    wide shallow square ended skimmer with a small version of the rigid slatted<br>
    wing rig he used on his day sailing cat at previous Speedweeks. The<br>
    Broadboard has been extensively tested and found to be very easy to handle.<br>
    Bob is offering the design as a kit or as a completed craft and has taken<br>
    several orders. The wing is pivoted from the top of a short mast and can be<br>
    inclined to produce both lift and forward drive, or can be set horizontal<br>
    when you want to park. The boat sailed well at the beginning of Speedweek<br>
    but was then put out of action when the transom became partially detached<br>
    from the rest of the hull.<br>
    <br>
    NICK POVEY<br>
    Nick has been thinking about possible ways of improving the performance of<br>
    sailboards - as if one needs to!<br>
    <br>
    Nicks ideas follow on from tests by Bob Spagnoletti using a sailboard with a<br>
    stepped planing surface. The idea is that splitting the planing surface into<br>
    two longitudinally separated regions will improve longitudinal stability and<br>
    also allow small angles of attack without excessive wetted area. It is a<br>
    principle which has often been tried on fast power boats and seaplanes but<br>
    has never become really popular. To develop the idea further Nick has built<br>
    what he called a 'development platform', this being a sailboard with a long<br>
    thin flat bottomed hull under which various types of planing surfaces can be<br>
    attached in various positions. At present there are simple plywood planing<br>
    skids, one at each end. Early trials are showing promise.<br>
    <br>
    As an aside, the author of these notes has in his workshop a similar sort of<br>
    'development platform' which did not quite make it to this years Speed Week.<br>
    My boat would be categorised as a single handed dinghy rather than a<br>
    sailboard since it does not have a universal joint at the mast foot. It is<br>
    smaller and lighter than almost any other dinghy I have seen, being perhaps<br>
    rather too close to a 'sinker dinghy'. Various lifting surfaces can be used<br>
    and if the boat will sail well enough I intend to try relatively deep<br>
    lifting hydrofoils and to compare these with planing skids and with the<br>
    narrow hull in displacement mode. One possibility I have in mind is a<br>
    hydrofoil which lifts the hull in the mid speed range then becomes a planing<br>
    surface at the top of the speed range.&nbsp; It occurred to me that Torix Benet's<br>
    boat might also be a suitable platform for such experiments - the fittings<br>
    on the back of each of his hulls might serve as mounts for my prototype<br>
    foils - what do you think, Torrix?<br>
    <br>
    NEILS HARBOSH<br>
    Last year Neil showed us his imaginative 'butterfly boat' with two masts<br>
    splayed apart at 90 degrees. This year he brought along a collection of boat<br>
    parts from which to build some more interesting boats. One was a trimaran<br>
    with floating free wheeling wheels in place of outriggers. With some hacksaw<br>
    work this trimaran could be converted into a kite powered boat with small<br>
    planing floats in place of the wheels. The boat sailed well in kite powered<br>
    mode but Neils said he could do with stronger wind. The kite is a 'Whipica'<br>
    kite which can be relaunched after landing in the water, i.e. it does not<br>
    become a huge bag of seawater as do some kites. The wheeled trimaran was<br>
    fascinating. The wheels have fat inner tube tyres about 1400mm overall<br>
    diameter. The cross beam is a pole and also serves as the axle for the<br>
    wheels. The idea is to save skin friction but Neils admitted that he is not<br>
    sure how well this works and with the simple bearings used there is no<br>
    certainty that the wheels will actually rotate when the craft is sailing.<br>
    <br>
    I believe that a steamship with floating wheels was built in Victorian<br>
    times. Considering the construction materials in use in this era I cannot<br>
    imagine how the wheels provided enough buoyancy unless they were as big as<br>
    the one which has just appeared opposite the Houses of Parliament in London,<br>
    in which case they would surely present a lot of windage.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="CHRIS EVANS">CHRIS EVANS</a><br>
    Chris bought two boats, one his very pretty daysailing trimaran with main<br>
    hull styling based on a Canadian canoe. This now has a new rig, the unstayed<br>
    una rig we saw two years ago being replaced with a much sturdier sloop rig<br>
    with stayed rotating wing mast and fully batted mainsail.<br>
    <br>
    Chris's second boat this year was a new trimaran designed in collaboration<br>
    with David Chinery. Last year David Chinery showed us a radio controlled<br>
    model of a trimaran with retractable foils which supplement stability in<br>
    displacement mode as well as allowing foil borne sailing in the right<br>
    conditions. Just 12 months later Chis has completed a 7.4m long version for<br>
    daysailing with a crew of one or two persons - that is pretty good going,<br>
    especially considering all the intricate parts and custom made metal work in<br>
    the boat. One of David's concerns was to avoid pitchpoling with strong wind<br>
    aft of the beam. To avoid this, the craft has a stern rudder in the form of<br>
    an inverted tee foil with manually adjustable incidence. This can be used<br>
    either to hold the stern down when running or as one of the lifting foils<br>
    when the craft is fully foil borne. The other two lifting foils are inclined<br>
    surface piercing foils mounted under the forward cross beams and are fully<br>
    retractable under remote control from the steering position which is right<br>
    aft. The hull is of 3.5mm ply coated in epoxy and to save weight there is no<br>
    cloth sheathing. Chris reckons that this type of construction can rival more<br>
    expensive composite materials for lightweight experimental craft which are<br>
    not intended to have a really long working life.<br>
    <br>
    BRISTOL SPEED SAILING TEAM.<br>
    The Bristol Speed Sailing Team can be relied upon for light hearted<br>
    entertainment and this year these diversions included a Speedweek song with<br>
    guitar accompaniment plus jokes by Bob Date. Since I missed some of the<br>
    words of the song and the jokes were not all printable I shall report only<br>
    the impressive technical achievements made this year.<br>
    <br>
    Last year the Bristol Speed Sailing Team produced a Dart catamaran fitted<br>
    with beautiful forward foils designed by the late Dave Keiper but at that<br>
    time the stern foil was not quite right. This year the stern foil<br>
    arrangements have been much improved with an inverted Tee foil mounted on a<br>
    nicely made framework of welded stainless steel tubes which attaches to the<br>
    hulls right aft and to the aft cross beam. All foils can be easily retracted<br>
    for sailing in shallow water. In the light winds on the Wednesday of this<br>
    evening meeting the boat achieved 14 knots, the record for the day.<br>
    <br>
    FRED BALL<br>
    Fred was sailing his 18 year old catamaran with inflatable hulls, the<br>
    forerunner of the successful Catapult design. This year Fred has modified<br>
    the boat by building plywood longitudinal structures which fit above each<br>
    hull to stiffen the hulls and also to allow the cross beams to be raised<br>
    about 300 mm higher off the water. The higher cross beams have reduced drag<br>
    since they no longer plough into the wave tops but increased weight has<br>
    offset this gain. The hull still lacks stiffness since the ageing fabric<br>
    cannot contain the full air pressure for long. Fred admitted the craft is at<br>
    or beyond the end of its working life.<br>
    <br>
    JOHN LINDSAY AND CHRIS HAYLE.<br>
    These speakers gave separate presentations but I shall report them together<br>
    since they make an interesting comparison. John Lindsay and Chris Hayle are<br>
    both marketing commercially manufactured sailing hydrofoils, these being the<br>
    Hobie Trifoiler and the new Rave. John has brought a Trifoiler to Speedweek<br>
    before whereas the Rave was new to Speedweek and Chis brought two samples<br>
    for prospective customers to play with. These products are in direct<br>
    competition, both being flying hydrofoils designed to be road trailable and<br>
    to carry one helmsman plus one optional passenger seated in a comfortable<br>
    cockpit. Both designs have fully immersed variable lift foils and small<br>
    floats at each end of a longish crossbeam, the lift of the foils being<br>
    automatically controlled by a mechanism connected to articulated surface<br>
    sensors. Both craft have anodised aluminium extrusions for spars, cross<br>
    beams etc, both are steered by a tee foil mounted aft and both have reefable<br>
    fully battened sails but that is about the end of the similarities.<br>
    <br>
    Foil lift control on the Trifoiler is by tilting the whole foil assembly<br>
    about a lateral axis. Foil lift control on the Rave is by actuating only a<br>
    full width trailing edge flap on each foil. Presumably these trailing edge<br>
    flaps can be controlled by relatively small forces explaining why the<br>
    surface sensors are much smaller and neater on the Rave than on the<br>
    Trifoiler.&nbsp; The two craft have quite different rigs. The Trifoiler has a<br>
    biplane rig with a mast step at each end of the cross beam, this giving a<br>
    reduced height of center of effort compared with a comparable single mast<br>
    rig of the same area. The Rave has a more conventional fore and aft rig with<br>
    self tacking jib and very square headed main. The main is boomless and the<br>
    clew of the main is sheeted to a single point near the transom. When the<br>
    sheet is eased a lot of twist appears in the main and perhaps this makes it<br>
    possible to spill wind high up whilst maintaining drive from the lower part<br>
    of the sail. The Trifoiler has foils moulded in composite materals, the<br>
    foils on the Rave are welded from aluminium extrusions. The Trifoiler has<br>
    composite laminated hulls, the hulls of the Rave are, I think, rotomoulded<br>
    and have an internal stiffening framework of aluminium tubing.<br>
    <br>
    So how did performance compare? Chris Hayle said that the Rave does need a<br>
    good wind to get foil borne but once it is flying it usually sails at around<br>
    40 knots with a maximum unofficially recorded at 46 knots. However, it has<br>
    to be said that the Trifoiler actually put up the best non-sailboard speed<br>
    of the week at 31.6 knots, the Rave did 24.5 knots. Amazingly, the best<br>
    speed of the Trifoiler was only about one knot slower than the best<br>
    sailboard speed. Chris suspected that the Rave could have been adversely<br>
    affected by some peculiar air turbulence caused by the way the wind flows<br>
    over Portland Bill.<br>
    <br>
    I must admit that I would never have expected flying sailing hydrofoils to<br>
    become a commercial possibility. I would have thought that such craft would<br>
    be far too vulnerable to damage by grounding and hence only suitable for mad<br>
    experimenters who are prepared for frequent rebuilds. This must be an<br>
    inherent difficulty but the foils are robustly made, especially on the Rave.<br>
    I noticed one of the Raves moored over a hard seabed with the foils left<br>
    locked down as the tide receded. At first the small waves caused the foils<br>
    to bump on the rocks then the foils came to support the full weight of the<br>
    craft. I was surprised that all this caused no obvious damage and indeed it<br>
    seems to be the standard way to park a Rave. Recently a Rave foil did catch<br>
    a small tethered buoy while sailing and the foil came off best - Chis was<br>
    able to show us a battle trophy in the form of the severed buoy dangling<br>
    from a mangled length of 6mm cordage. I do wonder what would happen if a<br>
    foil caught a heavy mooring chain while sailing fast, I suppose that the<br>
    helmsperson just has to make sure this never happens.<br>
    <br>
    Despite my scepticism, commercially built sailing hydrofoils are now<br>
    shipping, to use the parlance of the software industry. Chris Lindsay<br>
    claimed 200 recent sales, mostly in the States.&nbsp; They really do get<br>
    foilborne and in the conditions which suit them they can be significantly<br>
    faster than conventional monohulls and multihulls. However, unless we see<br>
    further developments, the sailboard continues to offer the most knots and by<br>
    far the most knots per buck. As a big bonus the sailboard gives you<br>
    remarkable seaworthiness, damage resistance and ease of transport on a car<br>
    roof rack. But you do need to be reasonably athletic and highly skilled to<br>
    make the most of a sailboard whereas it is reckoned that any couch potato<br>
    with sailing experience can climb aboard these hydrofoil craft and drive<br>
    away. You and your girlfriend sit in comfort in a light aircraft style<br>
    cockpit and it sounds to be as easy as taking a new sports car out of the<br>
    show room, not that I got the chance to try it myself. For quite a few<br>
    customers perhaps this could be a winning factor.<br>
    <br>
    JOHN MONTGOMERY AND SON ALEX<br>
    Alex Montgomery presented a superb 1/50th scale model made by his father and<br>
    representing his father's proposal for a catamaran to compete in the forth<br>
    coming race i.e. 'The Race'. During the past few Speedweek seminars we have<br>
    seen some beautifully made models but this one was really excellent, to the<br>
    best professional model making standard. The boat represented is a huge<br>
    Catamaran with slewing hulls and no less than four independent sail rigs<br>
    each mounted above one of the four slewing pivots at the junctions between<br>
    the hulls and the two cross beams. Dimensions are 37m hull length, 22.6m<br>
    beam, approximate sailing displacement 22 tons. Each rig has a boom extended<br>
    ahead of the mast to support the forestay in the manner of the proprietary<br>
    'Aero' rig. This gives no less than eight high aspect ratio sails. The booms<br>
    are made large enough to be the only working platforms required for the crew<br>
    to handle the sails and they also house roller reefing drums for each sail.<br>
    The unstayed wing masts rotate independently of the booms and the hull<br>
    slewing. The design of the mast pivots carries cantilever bending moments<br>
    directly from the masts into the cross beams reducing stresses in the hull<br>
    structure. There is three meter wave clearance under the cross beams and the<br>
    central pod with crew accommodation is mounted even higher. There are no<br>
    trampolines, the crew accessing the working platforms on the booms via<br>
    passageways though the centre of the hull slew bearings and on trolleys<br>
    which run though the hollow cross beams, like miners getting to a tight coal<br>
    face. I must say that the expanse of trampolines on boats such as Steve<br>
    Fosset's 'Playstation' do look to be lots of windage and quite heavy when<br>
    all is waterlogged so perhaps this is a better way for crew to get to their<br>
    working positions.<br>
    <br>
    The slew hull design allows the effective length of the craft to be<br>
    increased downwind to resist bow burying and helps in minimising aerodynamic<br>
    interference between the four rigs. A final point is that the centre boards<br>
    of Jon's proposed catamaran are mounted alongside rather than through the<br>
    hulls, following the arrangement on Jon's Catapult design. The boards and<br>
    rudders are all pivoted so that there is nothing to break off through<br>
    hitting floating objects, this being a mishap which has befallen so many<br>
    fast ocean racing yachts.<br>
    <br>
    If this boat reaches the start line it must be a formidable contender. Apart<br>
    from anything else it would be bigger than much of the competition. Also,<br>
    with four independent rigs, relatively low center of effort for minimum<br>
    capsise risk and damage resistant appendages this might just be the craft<br>
    that wins the race after all the others have broken up, broken down or sunk.<br>
    <br>
    Altogether an impressive proposal but as Alex said it still needs a lot of<br>
    money plus a lot of hurry to get it to the start line. I am sure the<br>
    Montgomeries would be very interested in any realistic ideas to achieve<br>
    this - wouldn't you be?<br>
    <br>
    JEAN HURTADO<br>
    Jean Hurtado starts his innovative boat designs with a balance of force<br>
    vectors. Previously this lead to a narrow hull and rig which both roll<br>
    through 90 degrees when tacking so inclining the rig to produce aerodynamic<br>
    lift to just balance the weight at a design apparent wind strength. This<br>
    year Jean has built a new boat which If anything is even simpler in concept<br>
    but is still based on the use of sail force to balance the total weight.<br>
    This time the sail is a low aspect ratio inclined fore sail mounted forward<br>
    for downwind sailing.&nbsp; Again, the idea is that at the design apparent wind<br>
    speed the weight is almost entirely carried by the rig. Hull drag is then of<br>
    little consequence and so a crude looking hull design will suffice, in this<br>
    case three aluminium drums fixed to a simple triangular frame. Best speed to<br>
    date is just 1.4 knots so, as Jean said, 'everyone will be really keen to<br>
    copy my ideas'. One can imagine that the concept would work much better<br>
    given just the right wind strength.<br>

    DAVID CHINERY<br>
    David showed us a neat little model of an articulated oar which he has<br>
    designed. Effectively the oar bends at the rowlock such that when you pull<br>
    on the inboard end the blade moves in the same direction as you pull, not<br>
    the opposite direction. This allows you to row facing forward which is much<br>
    pleasanter than conventional rowing. The mechanism looks quite simple to<br>
    make, it is based on cords and pulleys rather than gears or other precision<br>
    machined parts. David said that he had patented the design and he told us a<br>
    bit about the process for applying for a patent. There certainly have been<br>
    various other devices which allow forward facing rowing by comparable<br>
    mechanisms but David said that his design has the advantage of avoiding<br>
    excessive forces within the mechanism and can be used on almost any row boat<br>
    without strengthening the gunwhale or needing special rowlock mountings.<br>
    Just a short length of cord suffices to hold the device to the gunwhale.<br>
    <br>
    IAN HANNAY<br>
    Ian made some comments based on observations from on board his yacht 'Melina<br>
    of Fleet' which acted as mark boat at one end of the course.<br>
    <br>
    Ian commented that this has been an excellent Speedweek with better speed<br>
    sailing weather than we have had for many years. Impressive speeds had been<br>
    recorded and it appears that the performance gap between the sailboards and<br>
    the non-sailboards is closing. He said that in very rough terms<br>
    non-sailboard speeds are now around two third thirds of sailboard speeds<br>
    whereas in previous years they were about half sailboard speeds. (As stated<br>
    above, the best sailboard speed this year was actually only about one knot<br>
    faster than the best non-sailboard speed).<br>
    <br>
    Turning to details of boat design, Ian felt that some competitors are not<br>
    giving enough attention to rigs. He suggested that some of us are spending a<br>
    lot of time and money producing nice hulls then limiting performance by<br>
    using relatively crude rigs, often inappropriate rigs transplanted from some<br>
    other craft. In particular, Ian felt that standard sailboard rigs were<br>
    unsuitable for use on other types of craft which potentially have much<br>
    greater righting moment&nbsp; than a sailboard.&nbsp; Multiple rigs to give drive with<br>
    lower centre of effort could be given more consideration (two boats with<br>
    such rigs did compete this year and both achieved excellent results).&nbsp; I<br>
    could guess that Ian is a monohull man at heart when he said that a<br>
    multihull needs to be sailed like a monohull - i.e. you should be flying a<br>
    hull or two.<br>
    <br>
    BOB DOWNHILL<br>
    Bob Downhill made a quick mention of the hull drag measurements which he and<br>
    Fred Ball had been making during this Speedweek. These measurements are<br>
    quite simple to make and potentially most interesting. The method is to tow<br>
    various craft using Fred's 28 hp Dell Quay dory which is fitted with a good<br>
    speedometer and a rusty but apparently accurate spring balance attached to<br>
    the towline. Various craft had been measured and Bob appealed for more to<br>
    come forward. Most of the drag vs. speed plots showed a distinct hump in the<br>
    mid speed range and Fred did comment that in some cases this could be due to<br>
    the effect of the dory wake rather than the characteristics of the towed<br>
    hull. I find this a bit worrying - presumably the towline does need to be<br>
    long enough. I hope that in due course these results can be presented in an<br>
    AYRS journal.<br>
    <br>
    Bob Downhill concluded by saying how much he had enjoyed this excellent 25th<br>
    Weymouth Speedweek. He hopes to see us all back next year.<br>
