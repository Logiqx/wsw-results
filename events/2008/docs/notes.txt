Notes:

- Results for 20081004 were re-published after a discrepancy in the course length was discovered.
- e.g. Anders Bringdal harbour record was originally 38.48 but subsquently updated to 38.54.
- Jane Sanderson (sail 780) was awarded second place lady for a result of John Sanderson (sail 180).
- Times were HH:MM so changed them to be HH:MM:00 for the benefit of simpler code.
- Removed speeds for 111 (RIB / Bike) and 0 (Bike) on 20081006 and 20081008.
