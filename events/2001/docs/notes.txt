Paul Sleightholm appeared twice in the overall results of 2001; sail 14 and sail 671.

I initially changed sail number 14 to 671 in the file rundata/20011002_H1.csv

On reflection, I think this was incorrect and Ian Hill was using sail number 14 on 2 Oct 2001:

- Sail number 14 was used by Ian Hill on 5 Oct 2001 but he was missing from the weekly results.
- Sail number 14 was used by Ian Hill in 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005.

I have reverted the runs on 20011002 back to sail number 14, attributing those runs to Ian Hill.
