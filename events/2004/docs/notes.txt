Sail number changes:

- Changed sail number 43 to 430 and 56 to 560 in 20041003_S1.csv and entrants.csv
- The numbers 43 and 56 were also used by GBR-43 (Simon Langley) and GBR-56 (Keith Atkinson) on the Tue/Wed.

Determined that sail number 670 was probably Eddie Murrell:

- He was competing as sail 670 in subsequent years.
- Edward Murrell (sail 76) was shown on the entrants list but had no associated results so likely using 670.
