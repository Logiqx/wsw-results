Sail number changes:

- Changed sail number 43 to 430 and 56 to 560 in 20041003_S1.csv and entrants.csv
- The numbers 43 and 56 were also used by GBR-43 (Simon Langley) and GBR-56 (Keith Atkinson) on the Tue/Wed.

Determined that sail number 670 was probably Eddie Murrell:

- He was competing as sail 670 in subsequent years.
- Edward Murrell (sail 76) was shown on the entrants list but had no associated results so likely using 670.

Registration discrepencies - went with the names on published results:

- Entrants list showed John Langdown (sail 42) but results showed David Ellerbeck (sail 42).
- Entrants list showed Charlie Wilson (sail 43) but results showed Danny Norris (sail 43).
- Sail numbers for Hans-JÃ¼rgen and Theo Theinert were switched on the entrants list.

Missing rundata:
- Some rundata must be missing which corresponds to RESULTS_20041003_S1.csv
- e.g. 34,27.97,Sailboard,David Ellerbeck,8,42
