## WSW Results Reconciliation

Youth Fleet:
- 2005-2011 defined youths as less than 17 years of age on the first day of speed week.
- 2012 and onwards defined youths as less than 18 years of age on the 31st October.



### 2005

There are many Wayback Machine captures, including [6 Nov 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051106121739/http://www.speedsailing.com/Weymouth_2005.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 6 Nov 2005.
- Only the top 3 youths, masters and novices are known. The new reports are therefore limited to the top 3 for each category.



### 2006

There are many Wayback Machine captures, beginning with [12 Nov 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112055628/http://speedsailing.com/results_2006_overall.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 12 Nov 2006.
- There were 27 entrants for whom the am/pro/master details are unknown. This will obviously affect the category reports.



### 2007

The Wayback Machine captures include [30 Dec 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071230174904/http://www.speedsailing.com/2007%20Prizes.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 30 Dec 2007.
- Theo Theinert was originally awarded 3rd place amateur.
  - Robin Penna was actually faster and is the 3rd Amateur in the results produced by this project.
- Original results showed Richard Simpson as 3rd place junior but he was not a Junior in the daily results.
  - Changed Richard's entry to be a Junior (Youth) so the newly generated event results match the original publication.



### 2008

The Wayback Machine captures include [18 Oct 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20081018161048/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2008Results.htm) + [23 Dec 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20081223124230/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2008Results.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 23 Dec 2008.
- Only the top 3 of the pro/gold/amateur/novice/youth/master categories are known which limits any detailed reporting.
- These speeds are fractionally higher than those announced on the day, including the record by Anders; 38.54 was originally 38.48.
  - This was due to the discovery of a 1 metre discrepancy in the course length used in the calculations.
- Jane Sanderson (sail 780) was originally awarded 2nd place lady for a result of John Sanderson (sail 180).
  - This is not an issue in the newly generated results of this project and she is correctly listed as 3rd place lady.
- Speeds for 2nd and 3rd youths were originally a copy / paste error as they match the 2nd and 3rd place kite results.
  - This is not an issue in the newly generated results of this project and the speeds are correctly listed.



### 2009

The Wayback Machine captures include [15 Oct 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20091015043441/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/eventnews2009.htm) + [20 Oct 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20091020053824/http://speedsailing.com:80/eventnews2009.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 20 Oct 2009.
- Original result categories were included "Amateur Fleet", "Gold Fleet" and "Sailboard Pro Fleet".
  - The original "Amateur Fleet" and "Gold Fleet" winners excluded kites so they were essentially sailboard categories.



### 2010

The Wayback Machine captures only include [17 Oct 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20111017205719/http://www.speedsailing.com/2010ResultsTHUR.htm).

- These are only the end of day results so used the SSERPANT archive for reconciliation.
- SSERPANT's full list of results had Tony Morris and Tris Best appearing twice, listing 98 entrants in stead of 96.
  - This issue is not present in the results produced by this project.



### 2011

The Wayback Machine captures include [23 Oct 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111023232841/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2011Results.htm) + [14 Nov 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111114102021/http://www.speedsailing.com/2011Results.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 14 Nov 2011.
- Capture on 23 Oct 2011 showed Joseph Adams (Youth Sailboard) in the full results; 101 entrants listed.
  - He was subsequently removed from the online results (e.g. capture on 14 Nov 2011); 100 entrants listed.

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 28 Jan 2013.
- Although not stated in the event guide, youth sailboards appear to be excluded from fastest lady sailboards.
  - I've configured fastest lady sailboards accordingly, ensuring consistency with the original event results.
- Russell Clark appeared twice in the original results (#31 + #86) but only once in the new results (#31).
- The original results did not show non-Rookie Kites and Boats but they are included in the results created by this project.
