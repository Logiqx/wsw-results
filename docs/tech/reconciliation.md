## Reconciliation

This document relates to the re-generation of past WSW results and how they reconcile with the original results.

To begin with a quick note about the criteria for Junior / Youth Fleet:

- 2005-2011 defined juniors / youths as less than 17 years of age on the first day of speed week.
- 2012 and onwards defined youths as less than 18 years of age on the 31st October.



### 1998

- Name tweaks - changing first initial to first name:
  - Changed S Meech to Steve Meech; competed as a windsurfer in 2000.
  - Changed TL Watford to Trevor Whatford; competed as a windsurfer in every subsequent year.



### 1999

- There were no results for 4 Oct since they were lost prior to publication.
- Sail numbers assigned:
  - Assigned sail number 99 to Philip Middleton since he used it in all other years between 1998 to 2002.
  - Assigned sail number 68 to Kim Newman since he/she also used it in 2000 and 2001.
- Small observations:
  - Noted that Matthew Spooner (sail 150) was missing from the original daily results on 2 Oct and 3 Oct.
  - Noted that Cygnus Sails (sail 220) was missing from the original daily results on 7 Oct.



### 2000

- Sail number changes:
  - Changed sail number of Danny Norris + Will Oscroft on the tandem to 6222, distinct from Danny Norris 622.
  - Changed sail number of Chris Evans and Philip Middleton to 99. Stephen Corps retains sail number 15 in the results.
  - Decided that sail number 5 was likely to be Graham Holbert (Hulbert?) since he competed as sail number 5 in 1999 + 2001.
- Notes about rounding of 3 decimal places:
  - Note that 300m record on 2 Oct is 37.02 in day results but 37.03 in the full list of runs.
  - Day results rounded *down* to the nearest 100th but all runs rounded *up or down* to the nearest 100th.
  - This was not an issue in 1998 and 1999 because 3 decimal places were used in the full list of runs.
  - This issue affected all years between 2000 and 2004.



### 2001

- Confusion about sail number 14 which appears to be Ian Hill:
  - Paul Sleightholm appeared twice in the overall results of 2001; sail 14 and sail 671.
  - Sail number 14 was used by Ian Hill on 5 Oct but he did not appear in the weekly results.
  - Sail number 14 assumed to be Ian Hill on both 2 Oct and 5 Oct.
- Data fixes:
  - Run times for 4 Oct were between 02:00 and 06:00. Quickly hacked times to be 12:00 to 16:00.



### 2002

- No discrepancies found.



### 2003

- No discrepancies found.



### 2004

- Sail number changes, disentangling people with the same sail numbers during the event:
  - The numbers 43 and 56 were used by GBR-43 (Simon Langley) and GBR-56 (Keith Atkinson) on the Tue/Wed.
  - Changed other instances of sail numbers 43/56 to 430/560; affected 20041003_S1.csv and entrants.csv
- Determined that sail number 670 was probably Eddie Murrell:
  - Eddie was competing as sail 670 in subsequent years.
  - Edward Murrell (sail 76) was on the entrants list but had no associated results so seems likely to have used 670.
- Registration discrepancies - went with the names on published results:
  - Entrants list showed John Langdown using sail 42 but results showed David Ellerbeck using sail 42.
  - Entrants list showed Charlie Wilson using sail 43 but results showed Danny Norris using sail 43.
  - Sail numbers for Hans-JÃ¼rgen and Theo Theinert were switched on the entrants list.
- Missing run data:
  - Some run data must have been missing which corresponded to RESULTS_20041003_S1.csv
    - e.g. 34,27.97,Sailboard,David Ellerbeck,8,42



### 2005

There are many Wayback Machine captures, including [6 Nov 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051106121739/http://www.speedsailing.com/Weymouth_2005.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 6 Nov 2005.
- Only the top 3 youths, masters and novices are known. The new reports are therefore limited to the top 3 for each category.
- Handling of missing data:
  - Full list of runs for 8 Oct is unavailable as the web page was mangled
    - Took the best runs for 8 Oct  instead of using the truncated "all runs" data
  - Alex Montgomery (sail number 1) was missing from the top of "all runs" on 10 Oct
    - Added the best run from 10 Oct to the list of all runs with a time of 12:00:00
- Handling of bad data:
  - Removed 109.87 knot run for Mark Minter at 14:18:27
  - Removed "Non Entrant" on sail 420 who was sailing a Tornado Cat
  - Changed Dan Simpson's Sat result of 24.18 to 24.90 because that was his winning "Youth" speed
  - Noted that Bob Cunningham's Wed result was 26.41 because 27.21 was not listed in all runs
  - Noted that Mike Coombes' Fri result was 21.17 because 21.83 was not listed in all runs



### 2006

There are many Wayback Machine captures, beginning with [12 Nov 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112055628/http://speedsailing.com/results_2006_overall.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 12 Nov 2006.
- There were 27 entrants for whom the am/pro/master details are unknown. This will obviously affect the category reports.
- Data issues on 2 Oct:
  - Gordon roach had a run of 127.72 knots at 13:10:12 which I've removed manually.
  - Nick Brumfitt had a run of 1.68 knots (not shown in published results) which I've removed manually.
  - Michael John Roberts in day results as 29.48 but not in all runs. Added manually to "all runs" data.
- Data issues on 6 Oct:
  - Les Paley had a run of 4.98 knots (not shown in published results) which I've removed manually.
- Sail number changes:
  - Changed Jay Gwynn to sail 3333 to avoid conflict with Mark Hayford on 33. No runs associated with Jay.
  - Changed Ralph Morris to sail 311 to avoid conflict with Paul Morris on 31. No runs associated with Ralph.
- Classifications:
  - Decided that Austin Hind and Cory Percival were probably windsurfers based on Facebook profiles.



### 2007

The Wayback Machine captures include [30 Dec 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071230174904/http://www.speedsailing.com/2007%20Prizes.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 30 Dec 2007.
- Theo Theinert was originally awarded 3rd place amateur.
  - Robin Penna was actually faster and is the 3rd Amateur in the results produced by this project.
- Original results showed Richard Simpson as 3rd place junior but he was not a Junior in the daily results.
  - Changed Richard's entry to be a Junior (aka Youth) so the newly generated event results match the original publication.



### 2008

The Wayback Machine captures include [18 Oct 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20081018161048/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2008Results.htm) + [23 Dec 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20081223124230/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2008Results.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 23 Dec 2008.
- Only the top 3 of the pro/gold/amateur/novice/youth/master categories are known which limits any detailed reporting.
- Results for 4 Oct were re-published after a discrepancy in the course length was discovered
  -  e.g. Anders Bringdal harbour record was originally stated as 38.48 but subsequently updated to 38.54.
- Jane Sanderson (sail 780) was originally awarded 2nd place lady for a result of John Sanderson (sail 180).
  - This is not an issue in the newly generated results of this project and she is correctly listed as 3rd place lady.
- Speeds for 2nd and 3rd youths were originally a copy / paste error as they match the 2nd and 3rd place kite results.
  - This is not an issue in the newly generated results of this project and the speeds are correctly reported.
- Removed speeds for 111 (RIB / Bike) and 0 (Bike) on 6 Oct and 8 Oct.
- TBC - I'm not sure whether J.R. Morris is John Morris from 2006 and 2007. Left unchanged in case he is a different person.



### 2009

The Wayback Machine captures include [15 Oct 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20091015043441/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/eventnews2009.htm) + [20 Oct 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20091020053824/http://speedsailing.com:80/eventnews2009.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 20 Oct 2009.
- Original result category titles included "Amateur Fleet", "Gold Fleet" and "Sailboard Pro Fleet".
  - The published "Amateur Fleet" and "Gold Fleet" winners excluded kites so they were essentially sailboard categories.
  - The results generated by this project have therefore been configured as "Amateur Sailboards" and "Gold Fleet Sailboards".
- Data tweaks:
  - Removed Dave Standing 0.16 knots from all runs on 10 Oct.
  - Removed Anthony Baker 5.85 knots from all runs on 16 Oct.
  - Results for sail 559 (Tony Attfield) on 16 Oct were originally attributed to Tim Frampton. Fixed.



### 2010

The Wayback Machine captures only include [17 Oct 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20111017205719/http://www.speedsailing.com/2010ResultsTHUR.htm).

- These are only the end of day results so used the SSERPANT archive for reconciliation.
- The S1 + S2 + S3 course results overlapped on 18 Oct 2010 which resulted in lots of "duplicate" runs. Fixed the S2 + S3 data.
  - Fortunately this didn't affect the UKWA rankings which were entirely based on results of 19 Oct 2010.
- SSERPANT's full list of results had Tony Morris and Tris Best appearing twice, listing 98 entrants in stead of 96.
  - This issue is not present in the results produced by this project.



### 2011

The Wayback Machine captures include [23 Oct 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111023232841/http://www.speedsailing.com:80/2011Results.htm) + [14 Nov 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111114102021/http://www.speedsailing.com/2011Results.htm).

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 14 Nov 2011.
- Andrew Robinson (still under 17) should have been awarded the prize for first youth. His fastest was on Sun 16.
- Capture on 23 Oct 2011 showed Joseph Adams (Youth Sailboard) in the full results; 101 entrants listed.
  - He was subsequently removed from the online results (e.g. capture on 14 Nov 2011); 100 entrants listed.



### 2012

- The results generated by this project have been reconciled with the WM capture on 28 Jan 2013.
- Although not stated in the event guide, youth sailboards appear to be excluded from fastest lady sailboards.
  - I've configured fastest lady sailboards accordingly, ensuring consistency with the original event results.
- Russell Clark appeared twice in the original results (#31 + #86) but only once in the new results (#31).
- The original results did not show non-Rookie Kites and Boats but they are included in the results created by this project.
