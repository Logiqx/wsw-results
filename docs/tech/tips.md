## Weymouth Speed Week - Tips for 2022

2022 will some a combination of GT-31s and Motion Minis being used by entrants.

This document includes some general tips, plus suggestions for some of the rarer scenarios that may occur.

Some of the content has been copied from the "[gotchas](gotchas.md)" document.



### Late Entrants

Late entrants (including 2 day entries) can be added using the SSSEERPANT Event Manager.

Pro fleet sailboards (and open fleet kiteboards) will need to be assigned a Motion Mini (see section below).

Once the entrant has registered their GT-31 the SQL extract will need to be re-run for the reporting.



### Second Craft

Second craft will require an second entry to be added using the SSSEERPANT Event Manager.

Pro fleet sailboards (and open fleet kiteboards) will need to be assigned a Motion Mini (see section below).

Once the entrant has registered their GT-31 the SQL extract will need to be re-run for the reporting.



### Motion Mini

Pro fleet sailboards (and open fleet kiteboards) have been pre-assigned a Motion Mini.

Additional entrants can go afloat before their Motion is registered but be sure to take a note of its number!

The details will need to be added to the appropriate CSV, prior to running any reports at the end of the day.



### GT-31

What to do if an entrant's GT-31 needs to be replaced mid-competition:
  - Option 1: Register a second GT-31 via "event registration" on the SSERPANT laptop.
      - n.b. This will assign a new tally number and should register an additional GT-31 ID against the entrant.
  - Option  2: Manually configure a new GT-31 to have the same ID as the original; e.g. GEORG8MICHA.
      - n.b. This allows the tally number to be retained by the entrant and may reduce the risk of any confusion.



### GPSResults

Checklist for course timings:

- Specify time zone as +1 hour in GPSResults, prior to entering the course time limits.
- Add 1 minute to the "stop time" because the time filter uses the end times, not the start times.

Checklist for shore courses:

- Ensure the correct "track length" option is used; must be "500m start line" and not the default "500m".
- Ensure the shore course is wide enough for any runs far from the beach to be counted.

Checklist for harbour courses:

- If the start buoys drifted during the session then a good workaround is to use a "500m start line" course.



### Reporting

Session times should be specified within the new daily reporting as well as within GPSResults; belt and braces!

If any runs output by GPSResults are rejected by the reporting then the time limits need to be double-checked.
