## Weymouth Speed Week - Technical Docs

The documentation for this project has been broken down into a number of smaller topics.

All of the documentation has been written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) due to the simplicity of the language and native support on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).

The majority of the technical documentation can be found within the [sse-results](https://github.com/Logiqx/sse-results) project on GitHub.

The aforementioned technical [documentation](https://logiqx.github.io/sse-results/tech/) for sse-results can be found on GitHub pages.

Some of the technical documentation will be partially duplicated here, but any duplication will be kept to a minimum.
