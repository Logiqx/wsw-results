## Technical Docs

The documentation for this project has been broken down into a number of smaller topics.

All of the documentation has been written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) due to the simplicity of the language and native support on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).

Several of the topics have yet to be completed and may have little more than a working skeleton present, thus labelled "incomplete".
