## Motion Mini

### Background

During WSW 2022 we will trial the [Motion Mini](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/devices/motion/mini/) for all of the pro fleet sailboards and hopefully the pro kiters as well (if we have enough devices).

We believe the Motion Mini is perfect for Weymouth Speed Week. It's a handy little device that does not require an aqua pack as it is completely waterproof and there are no SD cards to handle at the end of each day. The built-in WiFi lends itself to self-service and much higher levels of automation.

Assuming things go well during Weymouth Speed Week 2022, we anticipate that all fleets will use the Motion Mini in 2023 and the event will be largely self-service. Since the Motions and the daily processes are (technically) going to be a trial in 2022 the WSW team will oversee the majority of the technical tasks.

Note: Pros may also wear a "backup" GPS in 2022, so long as it has been verified by [GP3S](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=GPSInfo). Examples of verified devices include the GT-31, GW-52, GW-60, Motion (LCD or Mini), ESP-GPS, Gyro-1 and COROS watches (APEX Pro, VERTIX, VERTIX 2). In the unlikely event of an issue with a Motion Mini the WSW team can look to retrieve data from the backup device for use in the results.



The remainder of this document attempts to summarize how the various technical processes may be implemented during WSW in 2022 and 2023.



### Registration

2022

- GT-31s:
  - GT-31 devices will be set up by competitors as per previous years; i.e. using one of the self-serve laptops, typically during on Fri (pm) or Sat (am).
- Motions:
  - Motion devices will be set up by the WSW team prior to the event (e.g. 5 Hz logging + WiFi details) and name labels attached (e.g. GEO25MIC).

2023

- Motions:
  - Motion devices owned by competitors should be set up prior to the event; e.g. 5 Hz logging + 5 knots min speed. The Motion firmware will contain the WiFi details.
  - Motion devices owned by WSW will be set up prior to the event; e.g. 5 Hz logging + 5 knots min speed. The Motion firmware will contain the WiFi details.
- During registration competitors should attach their name labels, connect their Motion to the WiFi and check that it appears on the event dashboard.
  - If the Motion does no appear on the event dashboard then the firmware and / or WiFi details can be checked / fixed.
  - If the Motion appears on the dashboard but is set up incorrectly (e.g. not logging at 5 Hz or min speed < 5 knots) then the issue will be highlighted and the relevant setting(s) will automatically be applied to the device.



### Track Downloads

2022

- GT-31s:
  - GT-31 devices will be handed in and the data downloaded using the existing processes.
  - Personal GT-31s will be available for collection once the data has been downloaded whereas hired GT-31s will be put on charge.
- Motions:
  - Motion devices will be handed in and the data downloaded straight to the event laptop using a new process that utilizes the event WiFi.
  - The trial Motions will be put on charge and will be available for collection the following day, when the pro sailors collect their tallies.

2023:

- Motions will be handled by the competitors themselves (with technical support available) and new data will be automatically downloaded to the event laptop via the event WiFi.
- Personal devices may be taken away by competitors once the data has been downloaded, whereas hired Motions will be put on charge.



### Reporting

2022

- GT-31 and Motion tracks will be processed by GPSResults.
- Newly created reporting software will use the output of GPSResults to generate the daily rankings and update the weekly rankings.

2023

- Motion tracks will be processed by GPSResults, or possibly some dedicated software to process each track as it is received.
- The same software as 2022 will use the output of GPSResults / dedicated software to generate the daily rankings and update the weekly rankings.

Note: The newly created reporting software has already been used to produce [results](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/index.html) for all years since 1998.



### Summary

2022

- 2022 will be a combination of the existing GT-31 processes and some new processes for the Motion Mini.
- GT-31 devices will be set up by competitors using the self-serve laptops and the WSW team will download daily data.
- Motion Minis will be set up in advance and the WSW team will oversee the download of daily data via the event WiFi.
- Reporting will use some newly created software, allowing results to published as quickly and efficiently as possible.

2023

- 2023 is likely to use the Motion Mini for all fleets. Every competitor will have the opportunity to entirely self-serve; setup, registration and daily downloads.
- Registration will involve a quick WiFi test to check that the Motion Mini can connect to the event WiFi and is set up correctly; e.g. 5 Hz logging and 5 knots min speed. If these settings are incorrect then they will be updated automatically.
- Automatic downloads of daily GPS data to the event laptop will be initiated by the competitors themselves (with technical support available) via the event WiFi.
- Reporting will use the same software as 2022, allowing results to published as quickly and efficiently as possible.



We are very much looking forward to the trial of the Motion Mini during Weymouth Speed Week 2022.

We hope to see you at the event!
