## Technologies

### Docker

The project utilises [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) so that it can be developed, implemented and maintained on a variety of operating systems with minimal effort. e.g. Windows, Mac or Linux.

TODO - Topics to be documented:

- [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) to use Linux commands on Windows; e.g. "find", "grep", "sed", "awk", "jq" and csvkit.
- How to download the project from GitHub. How to build + run the Docker image.



### Configuration

TODO - Choices and uses to be documented:

- Formats
  - [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
  - [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
- Configuration
  - Tweaking existing events; e.g. what should / should not be done.
  - Creating new event; e.g. how to set up a new event by cloning a previous event.



### Python

TODO - Topics to be documented:

- Use of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
  - Mention plans for Visual Studio Code
- Describe the modular design
  - Summarise the use of unit tests, etc.
- List the required Python libraries; automatically handled by the Docker "build "process.
  - csv + json
  - pyphonetics + Levenshtein
  - jinja
  - PIL
  - unittest



### Development

TODO - Explain how to develop, test, build and run via Docker.

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)



### Version Control

TODO - Summarise version control and web hosting:
