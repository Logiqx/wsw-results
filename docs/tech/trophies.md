## Trophies / Shields

### History

The trophies and shields have evolved slightly over the years.

Although this history has been applied to the results from 1998 to 2021, some of the trophies still need to be confirmed.

- Fastest Youth - Tushingham "Fastest Youth" Shield 2005 onwards.
  - 2010 included a photo of the shield with room for 7 names in total; e.g. 2005-2011. Criteria was <17 at start of speed week.
