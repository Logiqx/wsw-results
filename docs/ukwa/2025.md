## UKWA Speed Champions in 2025

[Weymouth Speed Week](https://www.weymouthspeedweek.com/) is an independent event, organised and run according to its own Event Guide and Policy Documents. All participants must comply with the policy, procedures and guidance of the Weymouth Speed Week event and the [WPNSA](https://www.wpnsa.org.uk/).

Weymouth Speed Week provides the [ISWC](https://www.internationalwindsurfing.com/), [UKWA](https://ukwindsurfing.com/) and [BKSA](https://britishkitesports.org/) with access to the results of the members of those organisations, so they can separately adjudicate any results that they may wish to use for their own purposes.

The UKWA does not organise or sanction Weymouth Speed Week, but recognises the results achieved by its members during the event. The UKWA crowns "Speed Champions" in Windsurf, Windfoil and Wingfoil disciplines based on those performances. 



### Heats

Weymouth Speed Week days are scheduled between 10:00 and 16:00, except for Saturday (first day) which is scheduled between 11:00 and 16:00. To ensure it is possible to compete in multiple disciplines the UKWA will treat each day of sailing as a single UKWA heat. This not only makes it feasible to partake in multiple disciplines, but also maximises the chances of each UKWA heat being deemed valid.

In previous years there were two UKWA heats each day (morning and afternoon) but a single heat aligns more closely with Weymouth Speed Week. Instead of needing just one good run per day for Weymouth Speed Week, participants require two good runs per day for the UKWA. Participants can plan their days based on the discipline(s) that they wish to compete in and the available weather forecasts.



### Scoring

Part F of the [ISWC Championship Rulebook 2010](https://www.internationalwindsurfing.com/userfiles/documents/ISWC_Rulebook_2010.pdf) has been adapted to suit the UKWA requirements.



#### Validity of Heats

A windsurf heat will be considered valid for the UKWA rankings if it meets either of the following criteria:

- At least 25% of the UKWA adult windsurfers who finish the heat achieve 27 kts (or more) at least 2 times
- At least 50% of the UKWA adult windsurfers who finish the heat achieve 25 kts (or more) at least 2 times

Each discipline will use the same principle for assessing heat validity, but using different thresholds.

| Discipline | 25%    | 50%    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Windsurf   | 27 kts | 25 kts |
| Windfoil   | 24 kts | 22 kts |
| Wingfoil   | 22 kts | 20 kts |

In addition there must be at least 4 UKWA adults for the discipline who actually finish the heat (i.e. complete at least 2 runs).



#### Scoring of Heats

Rankings for each heat will be based on the average speed of the two fastest runs of each participant. If a heat is considered valid, all competitors are awarded points equivalent to their finishing position, except the first place, which is awarded 0.7 points.

All competitors who do not start in a heat, who start and thereafter retire, who do not finish, who finish and thereafter retire or who are disqualified, score the points awarded to the last possible finishing position in that heat.



#### Discards

The discard system used at UKWA slalom events has been chosen for the UKWA speed rankings.

| Number of heats | Number of scores discarded |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 - 2           | 0                          |
| 3 - 5           | 1                          |
| 6 - 7           | 2                          |

The net points for each participant will exclude their worst score(s) and provide the basis for the overall rankings.



#### Ties

In the event of a tie (i.e. equal points in the overall rankings), it shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has achieved the best speed during the event. If the tie remains, it shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has the greater number of firsts, seconds, and so on. If the tie remains, it shall stand as the final result. 



#### Rankings

The event rankings will show the points awarded for each heat, plus the highest speed achieved during the whole event.

- Windsurf
  - Overall Windsurf
  - Male Windsurf
  - Female Windsurf
- Windfoil
  - Overall Windfoil
  - Male Windfoil
  - Female Windfoil
- Wingfoil
  - Overall Wingfoil
  - Male Wingfoil
  - Female Wingfoil



#### Trophies

The following trophies will be awarded to the UKWA "Speed Champions" for each discipline.

- Windsurf
  - Male Windsurf
  - Female Windsurf
- Wingfoil
  - Male Wingfoil
  - Female Wingfoil

Due to the limited number of entrants competing in the windfoil category there will be no trophies.
