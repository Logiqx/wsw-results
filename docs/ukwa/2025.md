## UKWA Speed Champions

Weymouth Speed Week allow the ISWC, UKWA and BKSA access to the results of members of those organisations and separately they adjudicate any results that they may wish to use for their own purposes.

Weymouth Speed Week is organised and run according to the Event Guide and Policy Documents. UKWA members <u>must</u> comply with the following sections of the Weymouth Speed Week Event Guide.

- Details of the 2025 Event
- Important Notices to all Competitors

The UKWA will crown "Speed Champions" based on the performance of the UKWA members during Weymouth Speed Week. There will be separate "Speed Champions" for Windsurf, Windfoil and Wingfoil disciplines.



### Sessions

Weymouth Speed Week sessions are scheduled between 10:00 and 16:00, except for Saturday (first day) which is scheduled between 11:00 and 16:00.

So that it is viable to compete in multiple disciplines (e.g. windsurf and windfoil, or windsurf and wingfoil) the UKWA will treat each Weymouth Speed Week session as a single leg. This not only makes it feasible to compete in multiple disciplines, but also maximises the chances of a valid leg.

In previous years there were two UKWA legs each day (morning and afternoon) but a single leg aligns more closely with Weymouth Speed Week. It is just that instead of 1 good run per day for Weymouth Speed Week, participants require 2 good runs per day for the UKWA.

Participants can plan their sailing based on the discipline(s) that they wish to compete in and the available weather forecasts.



### Scoring

Part F of the [ISWC Championship Rulebook 2010](https://www.internationalwindsurfing.com/userfiles/documents/ISWC_Rulebook_2010.pdf) has been adapted to suit the UKWA requirements.

- F2 - Validity of Scoring
- F3 - Leg scoring
- F4 - Round scoring
- F5 - Discards
- F6 - Event Ranking
- F7 - Ties in the Event Ranking



#### Validity of Scoring

An individual leg will be considered valid if the finishing UKWA seniors (i.e. non-youths) for the discipline meets either of the following criteria:

- At least 25% of the finishing UKWA seniors for the discipline have achieved the required speed at least 2 times
- At least 50% of the finishing UKWA seniors for the discipline have achieved the required speed at least 2 times

| Discipline | 25%    | 50%    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Windsurf   | 27 kts | 25 kts |
| Windfoil   | 24 kts | 22 kts |
| Wingfoil   | 22 kts | 20 kts |

In addition there must be at least 4 UKWA seniors for the discipline who actually finish the leg, completing at least 2 runs.



#### Scoring

Ranking within a single leg will be based on the average speed of the two fastest runs of each participant. If a leg is considered valid, all competitors are awarded points equivalent to their finishing position, except the first place, which is awarded 0.7 points.

All competitors who do not start in a leg, who start and thereafter retire, who do not finish, who finish and thereafter retire or who are disqualified, score the points awarded to the last possible finishing position in that leg.



#### Discards

The discard system used at UKWA slalom events has been chosen for Weymouth Speed Week. Dependant upon the number of discards permitted the highest and second highest scores may be discarded. The lowest total score with discards (if any) taken into account wins.

| Number of scores | Number of scores discarded |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 - 2            | 0                          |
| 3 - 5            | 1                          |
| 6 - 7            | 2                          |



#### Ties

In the event of a tie (i.e. equal points), it shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has achieved the best speed during the event. If the tie remains, it shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has the greater number of firsts, seconds, and so on. If the tie remains, it shall stand as the final result.
