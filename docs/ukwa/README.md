## UKWA Speed Championships

### Overview

There is a desire amongst UKWA sailors to tweak the rules of the Speed Championships so that moderately windy days can become valid legs. The current criteria are a simplification of the ISWC rulebook, which apply to international speed windsurfing competitions. Whilst the ISWC rules work fine for very windy days and gentle days, they don't always work so well for moderately windy days during the UKWA event.

The average ability of a UKWA competitor is lower than that of an international competitor, so use of the ISWC silver fleet criteria for the more capable UKWA competitors seems most appropriate. This proposal is for the use of silver fleet criteria from the ISWC rules (i.e. 28 knots for shore course, 26 knots for harbour course), applied only to the mens pro + gold fleets when determining whether a leg is valid.

Weymouth Speed Week are also considering some craft-specific "fun" series to encourage daily participation. The "fun" series would be similar to the UKWA series, but with different speed criteria. The criteria for sailboards would use the "bronze" fleet speeds from the ISWC rulebook (i.e. 26 knots for shore course, 24 knots for harbour course), applied only to the mens pro + gold fleets / open class (kites).



### Existing Rules

In recent years the UKWA has used the following criteria for legs to be considered valid:

> 1.1 Windsurfing Rounds will only count towards the UKWA windsurfing ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 28 knots two times. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.
>
> 1.2 Wing Foiling Rounds will only count towards the UKWA Wing Foiling ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 18 knots two time. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.



### Considerations

A number of points need to be considered with respect to the UKWA validation criteria:

- The average ability of UKWA windsurfers at Weymouth Speed Week is lower than those attending international competitions
  - Likewise, Portland Harbour cannot be considered a world class venue nowadays, unlike places like La Palme / Plage du Rouet
  - Speed criteria applied during an international speed competition serve as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions
  - Speed criteria applied during the UKWA Speed Championships not only reflect the conditions, but also the profile of the fleet
- The daily UKWA participation averages 19 persons (valid legs between 2010 and 2023), so speed criteria typically apply to 5 riders
  - The number of UKWA pro fleet riders competing all week during the championship has fluctuated in recent years
  - On average there have been 6 pro UKWA riders participating all week (2013 - 2023), but in 2023 there were only 4 UKWA pros
  - Just one or two fewer pro riders (rather than the conditions) can result in a UKWA leg being deemed valid, or not
- Weymouth Speed Week is primarily about participation and should be encouraging people to sail whenever possible
  - It should be noted that when UKWA youths (typically amateurs) are sailing it reduces the chances of UKWA leg(s) being valid
  - Legs that would be valid mid-week could be deemed invalid during the weekend, simply due to participation of UKWA youths
  - This proposal suggests using the mens pro fleet and gold fleet results as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions



### Data Analysis

A significant amount of analysis has been undertaken prior to presenting this proposal, using all possible 116 UKWA legs between 2010 and 2023. The full analysis will not be written up in detail because it would take many days to do so clearly and be easily understood.

The analysis included ideas such as median speeds of the fleet and how they can increase the statistical robustness of validity checks, relevance of the interquartile range, restricting criteria to mens pro + gold fleet sailors and possible lowering of the speed criteria.

The most effective / appropriate change was deemed to be use of mens pro + gold fleet results as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions, and using the "silver" fleet speed criteria from the ISWC rulebook. Two sessions in recent years would be affected by this change:

- Leg 2 on Wed [11 Oct 2023](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2023/20231011/ukwa.html) would be deemed valid
- Leg 2 on Tue [18 Oct 2022](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2022/20221018/ukwa.html) would be deemed valid

In addition to the above legs in 2023 and 2022, another 7 legs between 2012 and 2015 would also be deemed valid based on 25% of the mens pro + gold fleet riders. This new rule is easy to implement and can still be applied manually, if required.




### UKWA Series

The average UKWA pro and gold fleet riders cannot be expected to perform at the same level as competitors attending an international competition. The criteria for a silver fleet have therefore been deemed most appropriate for the combination of UKWA pro and gold fleets.

The proposal below is based on the ISWC wording (included at the end of this document), and uses the speed criteria of a silver fleet.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

| UK Speed Championships | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Windsurf / Windfoil    | 28 knots     | 26 knots       |
| Wingfoil               | 25 knots     | 23 knots       |

n.b. Increased speed requirements for the UKWA wingfoil fleet have been determined using 2022 and 2023 results.




### Fun Series

Weymouth Speed Week are considering an additional "fun" series to encourage daily participation from sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard competitors, running alongside the UKWA Speed Championships. The format of the "fun" series will be practically identical to the UKWA Speed Championships, including the same pre-agreed times for lunch.

All sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard participants of Weymouth Speed Week will automatically be entered into the applicable "fun" series, regardless of UKWA membership. There will be several "fun" series, either catering for all six combinations of sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard and men / women, or three individual series for sailboards, wingboards, and kiteboards (i.e. combining men and women).

The WSW course(s) will remain open during any pre-agreed lunch breaks. Competitors will still be allowed to do speed runs during the lunch break, which will qualify for daily tankards and end of week prizes. However, runs during the lunch period will not count towards the UKWA Speed Championships or the WSW "fun" series. Like the UKWA series, "fun" series will have a maximum of two legs each day; AM and PM.

The proposed rules for the "fun" series are very similar to those of the UKWA series, just using relaxed speed criteria. The criteria for sailboards will use the "bronze" fleet speeds in the ISWC rulebook, but will only consider finishers within the mens pro + gold fleets. The relaxed sailboard speed criteria have been chosen to allow for healthy competition on hydrofoils when the wind is light, but not too light.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing racers in the mens pro + gold fleets (sailboards / wingboards), or open class fleet (kiteboards) have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

| Weymouth Speed Week - "Fun" Series | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Sailboards                         | 26 knots     | 24 knots       |
| Wingboards                         | 23 knots     | 21 knots       |
| Kiteboards                         | 28 knots     | 22 knots       |

Note: Speeds for the kiteboards have yet to be discussed with any of the kiters.



### Conclusions

Tweaking the way that speed criteria are applied during the UKWA Speed Championships will allow moderately windy days to deemed as valid legs. The changes aren't huge and have been proposed to account for the differences between the average UKWA rider vs international riders.

The "fun" series with slightly relaxed speed criteria are to encourage daily participation from all sailboards, wingboards, and kiteboards. These would not have official prizes or trophies, but are expected to provide riders with additional "purpose" on the less windy days.



### Reference

The following section from the ISWC rulebook has been used as reference. Since the UKWA competitors are on average not of an international standard, speed requirements for "silver" fleet will only be applied to UKWA finishers in the mens pro and gold fleets.
