## UKWA Speed Championships

### Existing Rules

In recent years the UKWA has used the following criteria for legs to be considered valid:

> 1.1 Windsurfing Rounds will only count towards the UKWA windsurfing ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 28 knots two times. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.
>
> 1.2 Wing Foiling Rounds will only count towards the UKWA Wing Foiling ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 18 knots two time. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.



### Considerations

A number of points need to be considered with respect to the UKWA validation criteria:

- The overall standard of UKWA windsurfers at Weymouth Speed Week is lower than participants attending international competitions
  - Likewise, Portland Harbour cannot be considered a world class venue, unlike places like La Palme / Plage du Rouet
  - Speed criteria applied during an international speed competition serves as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions
  - During the UKWA Speed Championships, speed criteria not only reflect the conditions but also the profile of the participants
- The daily UKWA participation averages 19 persons (valid legs between 2010 and 2023), so speed criteria typically consider 5 riders
  - The number of UKWA pro fleet riders competing all week during the championship has been variable in recent years
  - On average there have been 6 pro fleet riders participating all week (2013 - 2023), but in 2023 there were only 4 UKWA pros
  - One or two fewer pros / top riders can easily make the difference between a UKWA leg being deemed valid, or not
- Weymouth Speed Week is primarily about participation and should be encouraging people to sail whenever possible
  - It should be noted that when UKWA youths (typically amateurs) are sailing it reduces the chances of the UKWA leg being valid
  - Results that would be valid mid-week could be deemed invalid during the weekend, simply due to participation of the youths
  - This proposal is based on the results pro fleet and gold fleet riders as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions



### Data Analysis

A significant amount of analysis has been undertaken prior to presenting this proposal, using all 116 UKWA legs between 2010 and 2023. The full analysis will not be written up in detail because it would take many hours / days to do so in a form that is clear and can be easily understood. The analysis included ideas such as the exploration of how median speeds of the fleet could be used to increase statistical robustness (additional to the 25% rule), restricting criteria to just the pro + gold fleet sailors and possible lowering of the speeds themselves. The most appropriate change was determined to be the use of combined pro fleet and gold fleet results as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions, and using the "silver" fleet speed criteria in the ISWC rulebook.




### Proposed Rules

The proposed wording is similar to that used in the ISWC rulebook, with speeds based on the ISWC criteria for a silver fleet.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

Changes to the speed requirements for the UKWA wingfoil fleet are also proposed.

| UK Speed Championships | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Windsurf / Windfoil    | 28 knots     | 26 knots       |
| Wingfoil               | 25 knots     | 23 knots       |




### Additional "Fun" Series

Weymouth Speed Week are hoping to run an additional "fun" series to encourage daily participation from sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard competitors, running alongside the British Speed Championship. The format of the "fun" series will be practically identical to the UKWA, including the same pre-agreed times for lunch. All sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard participants will be entered into the applicable "fun" series, regardless of UKWA membership. There will be six different "fun" series, catering for all combinations of sailboard / wingboard / kiteboard and men / women.

It should be noted that the speed course(s) will remain open during the pre-agreed lunch breaks. Competitors will still be allowed to do runs during the lunch break, thus qualifying for daily tankards and end of week prizes. Runs during the pre-agreed lunch break will not be counted towards the UKWA or "fun" series. The "fun" series will have a maximum of two legs each day; morning and afternoon.

The proposed rules for the "fun" series are similar to those of the UKWA series, just using speed criteria that are slightly lower. The speeds for sailboards are equivalent to the "bronze" fleet criteria in the ISWC rulebook, but applied to finishers within the mens pro + gold fleets.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing racers in the mens pro + gold fleets (sailboards / wingboards), or open class fleet (kiteboards) have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

| Weymouth Speed Week - "Fun" Series | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Sailboards                         | 26 knots     | 24 knots       |
| Wingboards                         | 23 knots     | 21 knots       |
| Kiteboards                         | 26 knots     | 24 knots       |

Note: Speeds for the kites have yet to be decided and currently reflect the windsurfer speeds.




### Reference

The following section from the ISWC rulebook has been used as reference. Since the UKWA competitors are on average not of an international standard the speed requirements for "silver" fleet may be applied to UKWA competitors in the pro fleet and gold fleet.
