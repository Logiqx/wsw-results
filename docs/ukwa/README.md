## UKWA Speed Championships

### Existing Rules

In recent years the UKWA has used the following criteria for legs to be considered valid:

> 1.1 Windsurfing Rounds will only count towards the UKWA windsurfing ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 28 knots two times. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.
>
> 1.2 Wing Foiling Rounds will only count towards the UKWA Wing Foiling ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 18 knots two time. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.



### Considerations

A number of points need to be considered with respect to the UKWA validation criteria:

- The overall standard of UKWA riders attending Weymouth Speed Week is somewhat lower than European / World Championship events
  - Likewise, Portland Harbour may not be considered a world class venue like La Palme (Plage du Rouet) or similar
  - Applying the speed criteria during an international speed competition serves a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions
  - During the UKWA Speed Championships, applying the speed criteria not only reflects the conditions but also the profile of the riders
- The average UKWA participation for valid legs between 2010 and 2023 was 19 persons, so the speed criteria typically applies to just 5 riders
  - The number of UKWA pro fleet riders competing throughout the entirety of the week has been variable in recent years
  - On average there have been 6 pro fleet riders fully participating in the championships (2013 - 2023), whereas in 2023 there were just 4 pros
  - One or two fewer pros / top riders in the fleet can easily make the difference between a round being deemed valid, or not
- Weymouth Speed Week is primarily about participation and we should be encouraging people to sail whenever possible
  - It should be noted that when UKWA youths (typically amateurs) are sailing it reduces the chances of a counting round
  - Results that would be deemed valid mid-week, could be deemed invalid during the weekend simply due to participation of the youths
  - The proposal is to use the results of pro fleet and gold fleet riders as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions



### Data Analysis

A significant amount of analysis has been undertaken prior to presenting this proposal, using all 116 UKWA legs between 2010 and 2023. The analysis include ideas such as determining how the median of the fleet might also be used to increase the statistical robustness, restricting the rules / checks to just pro + gold fleet sailors and changes to the speeds / criteria. The most beneficial change was determined to be using just the pro fleet and gold fleet as a proxy for the quality / suitability of the conditions and using silver fleet criteria from the ISWC.




### Proposed Rules

The proposed wording is similar to that used in the ISWC rulebook, with speeds based on the ISWC criteria for a silver fleet.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

New speed requirements for the UKWA wing fleet are also proposed.

| Weymouth Speed Week - Windsurf / Windfoil | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Windsurf / Windfoil                       | 28 knots     | 26 knots       |
| Wingfoil                                  | 25 knots     | 23 knots       |




### Additional "Fun" Series

Weymouth Speed Week are hoping to run an additional "fun" series to encourage daily participation from sailboard, wingboard and kiteboard competitors, running alongside the British Speed Championship. The competition formats will be practically identical, including the same pre-agreed times for lunch. All sailboard, wingboard and kiteboard participants will be entered into the applicable "fun" series, regardless of UKWA membership.

n.b. It should be noted that the course will remain open during the pre-agreed lunch break. Competitors will still be free register runs during the lunch break, qualifying for daily tankards and end of week prizes. Runs during the pre-agreed lunch break just won't count towards the UKWA or "fun" series. 

The proposed wording for the "fun" series is similar to that proposed wording for the UKWA series, just using speed criteria that are 2 knots lower.

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing racers in the fleet have been recorded at least two times at a certain speed. The following matrix shows the necessary speeds for each fleet:

| Weymouth Speed Week - Windsurf / Windfoil | Shore course | Harbour course |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Windsurf / Windfoil                       | 26 knots     | 24 knots       |
| Wingfoil                                  | 23 knots     | 21 knots       |
| Kitesurf / Kitefoil                       | 26 knots     | 24 knots       |




### Reference

The following section from the ISWC rulebook has been used as reference. Since the UKWA competitors are on average not of an international standard the speed requirements for "silver" fleet may be applied to UKWA competitors in the pro fleet and gold fleet.
