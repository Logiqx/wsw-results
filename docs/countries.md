## Countries

Nationalities use 3 character abbreviations from a number of organisations.



### Organisations


#### International Organization for Standardization - ISO Codes

International Organization for Standardization created and maintains a list of codes for the representation of countries and their subdivisions. These are officially known as [ISO 3166 Codes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

They are three sets of ISO 3166 codes; two-letter codes, three-letter codes and numeric codes. There are codes for 249 countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest.



#### International Olympic Committee - IOC Codes

The International Olympic Committee are probably most recognised. These are commonly known as [IOC codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes).

There are 206 current NOCs (National Olympic Committees) within the Olympic Movement.

e.g. The IOC country code for Germany is "GER" which differs from the ISO codes of "DEU" and "DE".



#### World Sailing Organisation - MNA Codes

The World Sailing Organisation use codes derived from the International Olympic Committee. These are referred to as Member National Authority codes; [MNA codes](https://www.sailing.org/raceofficials/eventorganizers/mna_codes.php).

There are 146 current Member National Authorities with a 3-letter code.

A few notes:

- Taiwan ("TWN") is referred to as [Chinese Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei) ("TPE") by the IOC and WSO.
- [Netherland Antilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_Antilles) (Curacao and St Maarten) have a joint MNA code of "AHO" but different codes in ISO 3166; "CUW "and "SXM".
- There are currently 3 countries with an MNA code that is different to the latest IOC code; Iran, Lebanon and Nigeria.
- There are currently 3 countries with an MNA code but no IOC code; Montserrat, Tahiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands.



### Weymouth Speed Week

The results for Weymouth Speed Week prioritise country codes as follows:

1. MNA Code - World Sailing Organisation
2. IOC Code - International Olympic Committee
3. ISO 3166 Code - International Organization for Standardization



A few tweaks have been made after applying the above priories since the ISO 3166 code may be confusing:

- Guernsey; "GSY "instead of "GGY"
- Jersey; "JSY "instead of  "JEY"
- Western Sahara; "WSH "instead of "ESH"



Note: There are 251 countries in total which is 2 more than the current list of ISO 3166 countries.

- Kosovo has been added from the International Olympic Committee's list of National Olympic Committees.
- Tahiti has been added from the World Sailing Organisation's list of Member National Authorities.
