## UKWA Speed Championships

### Existing Rules

In recent years the UKWA has used the following criteria for legs to be considered valid:

> 1.1 Windsurfing Rounds will only count towards the UKWA windsurfing ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 28 knots two times. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.
>
> 1.2 Wing Foiling Rounds will only count towards the UKWA Wing Foiling ranking, when 25% of the riders registered achieve over 18 knots two time. One completed round is needed to ratify the event.



### Thoughts

- Average participation
  - Typically 15 competitors in a UKWA leg (median = 15.5, mean = 15.4, min = 1, max = 34)
  - Typically 6 pro fleet riders participate throughout the whole week (median = 6.0, mean = 6.1, min = 4, max = 9)
    - 2021 and 2023 had the fewest UKWA pros competing all week - just 4 competitors
- Natural variation
  - coin toss analogy - [link](http://probability.ca/jeff/writing/margerror.html)
    - "Suppose you flip a coin ten thousand times. How many heads will you get? On each flip, the coin has equal probability of coming up heads or tails. So, on AVERAGE, you will get five thousand heads and five thousand tails. On the other hand, it doesn't seem likely that you will get EXACTLY five thousand heads -- rather, you will get "about" five thousand heads. But how much UNCERTAINTY is there around that mean value? That is, how far off from five thousand can we expect it to be? Might you get six thousand heads? Seven thousand? Or will you usually get between 4995 and 5005?"
    - On balance, might expect 50 / 50 but there is only a 25% probability of 50 / 50
    - The most likely outcome is 6 of one and 4 of the other - 41% chance
    - Looking at real-world data from multiple perspectives provides greater insight than any single measure
- Robust measures - median, interquartile range (upper quartile / lower quartile)
  - simplified versions - at least 25%, at least 50%
  - what would the 50% equivalent be for 28 knots?
  - relationship of upper quartile and median for UKWA - include chart
  - need for both
- 25% with 27-28 knots occurred 10 times
  - 0 times were counting rounds if 25% > 28 knots
  - 5 times would be counted if 50% > 26 knots



### Deficiencies

#### 25% over 28 knots

- [Wed 19 Oct 2011](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2011/20111019/ukwa.html) - #9 = 26.12 knots
- [Mon 5 Oct 2015](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2015/20151005/ukwa.html) - Leg 1 #13 = 26.05 knots
- [Wed 11 Oct 2023](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2023/20231011/ukwa.html) - Leg 2 #13 = 26.25 knots



#### 50% over 26 knots

- [Fri 12 Oct 2012](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2012/20121012/ukwa.html) - Leg 2 # 6 is 28.12 knots. It is also a really good example of random variation in run 2 (#6 and #11)
- [Sat 13 Oct 2018](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2018/20181013/ukwa.html) - Leg 1 #7 = 28.95 knots
- [Thu 18 Oct 2018](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2018/20181018/ukwa.html) - Leg 1 #5 = 28.32 knots
- [Wed 19 Oct 2022](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/2022/20221019/ukwa.html) - Leg 1 #3 = 30.28 knots

Conclusion - not worth having 27 knot criteria for harbour course as it only affects 2 legs (1 day) between 2010 to 2023





### Possible Criteria - 25% and 50%

#### Summary

The newly proposed wording is similar to that used in the ISWC rulebook, and the speed criteria are based on the ISWC rules for a silver fleet.

All criteria for a valid windsurfer leg are in relation to the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets:

| British Speed Championship - Windsurf / Windfoil | 25%  | 50%  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Shore course                                     | 28   | 26   |
| Harbour course                                   | 26   | 24   |

All criteria for a valid wingfoiler leg are in relation to the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets:

| British Speed Championship - Wingfoil | 25%  | 50%  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Shore course                          | 25   | 23   |
| Harbour course                        | 23   | 21   |

The Weymouth Speed Week series is to encourage daily participation, running alongside the British Speed Championship. All WSW speed requirements are 2 knots lower than the UKWA requirements.

| Weymouth Speed Week - Windsurf / Windfoil | 25%  | 50%  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Windsurf / Windfoil - Shore course        | 26   | 24   |
| Windsurf / Windfoil - Harbour course      | 24   | 22   |

Likewise for the windfoil category.

| Weymouth Speed Week - Wingfoil | 25%  | 50%  |
| ------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Wingfoil - Shore course        | 23   | 21   |
| Wingfoil  - Harbour course     | 22   | 20   |

Kites TBC... currently showing windsurfer speeds.

| Weymouth Speed Week - Kitesurf / Kitefoil | 25%  | 50%  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Wingfoil - Shore course                   | 26   | 24   |
| Wingfoil  - Harbour course                | 24   | 22   |



#### Wording for Windsurfers + Windfoilers

Shore course

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 28 knots, or at least 50% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 26 knots.

Harbour course

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 26 knots, or at least 50% of the finishing racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 24 knots.



#### Wording for Wingfoilers

Shore course

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 25 knots, or at least 50% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 23 knots.

Harbour course

> One leg is considered valid when at least 25% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 23 knots, or at least 50% of the finishing UKWA racers in the mens pro + gold fleets have been recorded at least two times over 21 knots.
