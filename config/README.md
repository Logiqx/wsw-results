# Configuration

## Background

The legacy Excel configuration was initially converted from CSV to JSON using an online tool:

- [Convert CSV to JSON](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm)

Note: The only non-default option selected was 'Do Not output field/value pair if value is empty'



## Overview

This folder contains a number of configuration files to generate results for Weymouth Speed Week (WSW).

The configuration files are an evolution of the Excel spreadsheet that was used up to and including WSW 2021.

| Filename         | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| config.json      | Main configuration |
| daily.json       | Daily report definitions |
| leaderboard.json | Leaderboard report definitions |
| README.md        | This file |
| stats.json       | Statistical summary definitions |



## TBC

A couple of oddities in the reporting filters need to be clarified:

1. "Leading Boats" excludes first timers, whereas "Leading Kites" does not exclude first timers.
2. "Women's Sailboard Fleet" excludes youths which isn't mentioned in the event guide.



Some additional rankings could also be added for 2022:

1. "All Kite Boards" could be added beneath "All Sailboards" on the leaderboard web page.
2. Wings could also be added in their own right, much like the kite and boat rankings.
